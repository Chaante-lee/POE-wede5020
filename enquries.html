        <br>
    The SPCA relies mainly on bequests and donations from the public. We rely on public support in order to continue to do the work we do. There are various ways to support and get involved with our work.
    The Sandton SPCA currently has a dog walking volunteer programme that runs on Saturday mornings from 09:00 until about 12:00.
    Volunteering at the SPCA is not just about walking dogs. We look for people with skills that will help us to help the animals.
    Without donations from the public, we are not able to sustain our activities.
