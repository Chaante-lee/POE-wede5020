     <h2><u>About us</u></h2>
    
     <p style="color: black; text-justify: auto;"> National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (South Africa) is a 
        registered non-profit organisation and public benefit organisation, 
        an incorporated association not for gain and a member of the National Council of SPCAs.
        We rescue abused and neglected domestic, farm and wild animals, promote responsible pet ownership,
         provide a shelter for strays, and a veterinary service for pets of underprivileged people.

        We receive no state funding and are reliant on the community we serve for operating costs. 
        Compassion costs nothing, but pet food, veterinary equipment and supplies, vehicles for 
        transporting rescued animals, etc. We also gratefully accept donations of pet
        food which may be dropped off at our premises in locations like springfield park,kzn. kloof,kzn. Sandton,Johannesburg.so forth.

        The SPCA's trained inspectors investigate reports of animal abuse, neglect, and ill-treatment,
        including dog fighting and illegal street selling of pets. We have the authority to rescue animals from dangerous conditions
        and can instigate legal action against offenders. SPCA animal hospitals offer veterinary care for domestic, equine, and farm animals.
         Some branches also operate mobile clinics to provide care to underprivileged communities and offer services like vaccinations and sterilization to prevent disease.
    <br>
    <br>
        Our primary and motivating concern is the prevention of cruelty to all living creatures and the promotion of the humane treatment of animals through leadership, education, and law enforcement.
        Although the animal welfare issues are considered in the South African context, the NSPCA provides guidance and information to other countries whenever possible, and also provides support for international campaigns which further its objectives.
