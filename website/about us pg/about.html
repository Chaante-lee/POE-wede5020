     <h2>About us</h2>
     <p>The Durban & Coast Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (South Africa) is a 
        registered non-profit organisation (002-312 NPO) and public benefit organisation (PBO 930001302), 
        an incorporated association not for gain and a member of the National Council of SPCAs.

        We rescue abused and neglected domestic, farm and wild animals, promote responsible pet ownership,
         provide a shelter for strays, and a veterinary service for pets of underprivileged people.

        We receive no state funding and are reliant on the community we serve for operating costs. 
        Compassion costs nothing, but pet food, veterinary equipment and supplies, vehicles for 
        transporting rescued animals, etc. We also gratefully accept donations of pet
        food which may be dropped off at our premises in locations like springfield park,kzn. kloof,kzn so forth.</p>
